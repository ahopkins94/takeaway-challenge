#How to run automated tests

- Run rspec in your terminal
- This will indicate how many tests there are and have many failed
- They are testing the menu.rb and order.rb ruby documents for errors such as failing methods, unexpected outcomes, undefined variables etc
- They are testing ruby language

#How to deploy on your system

- Require all the ruby files in the lib folder
- Create an instance of a menu
- Add items to the order through the add method (add(number of item)) of menu
- Delete an item from the order through the delete method (delete(number of item)) of menu
- Check the total through the check_total method (check_total(number you think is total)) of menu
